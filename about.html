						<h5>Alyn Migdol, Manager</h5>
						<p>Alyn has never worked in housing for any span of time. However, she is incredibly bossy and has a furocious bark that motivates even the dead.  When Alyn isn't working for Tiny House Consulting, she can be seen playing fetch, or "keep away", begging for constant snuggles, playing with other dogs, and having chronic food and environmental allergies.</p>

						<h5>Aldous Gracey, Interior Design</h5>
						<p>Aldous has kept a positive attitude for 100% of his life.  This rubs off on the team and keeps everyone in a good mood.  Not only does Aldous' attitude help others, but so does his oh-so-soft fur.  When he gets groomed, it's like touching pure fleece on fleece.  #amazing.</p>
